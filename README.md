### Notes on development
*The general idea*
- I wanted to use google maps API with the geometry, drawing and places libraries to explore the features of the google maps api and use of javascript with APIs
- Using google maps we will be displaying markers for locations and infowindows
- I wanted to use Foursquare API to retreive information on phonenumbers as an external API
- I wanted to use Knockout.js with the MVVM design pattern
- Atleast one API will be accessed using jQuery AJAX requests
- Page should be designed with responsiveness in mind
- App also features
